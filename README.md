# Frag Steal

This is a silly Discord bot written to play sound files on a Discord Server.
It's limited to mp3 audio files, but it is easily extensible.

# Requisites

Node >= 8

FFMPEG

# Install

`npm install`

`node discord_bot.js`

# Configuration

Copy `bot.json.example` to `bot.json` and set the bot token and command prefix.

# Usage

Copy your mp3 files to the script folder, the command is based on the set command prefix and the filename. E.g.: `!botmoo` plays `moo.mp3`.
